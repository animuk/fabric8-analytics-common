  * Visual (UI) tests for the Analytics extension for the Visual Studio Code

## TL;DR;

There are two approaches how to test Analytics plugin in VS Code via UI:

### Approach #1

  * use Selenium + Web Driver because VS Code is based on Electron

#### Pros

  * QA people know this approach a bit

#### Cons

  * VS Code GUI is autogenerated, there are no IDs for tags etc.
  * it really does not check what users see on their screen

### Approach #2

  * use PyAutoGUI library to match regions on screen, click on them etc.

#### Pros

  * straightforward
  * tests what users really see and can click on

#### Cons

  * flaky, depends on actual rendering engine settings

### Solution

-> Use an interface and add a separated layer between #1/#2 and actual tests

## Solution checked so far

1. Tests are written in Behave (BDD)
2. Implementation of test steps use PyAutoGUI

## Examples

### Test that installs Analytics plugin using high-level test steps (click on the named widget etc.):

```
Feature: Visual Studio Code + the Analytics plugin basic functionality

    Scenario: Check that the Analytics plugin can be found in the Marketplace
        Given The PyAutoGUI library is initialized
          And The screen resolution is at least 1024x768 pixels

         When I start the Visual Studio Code
         Then I should find Visual Studio Code instance

         When I click on the extension icon on the activity bar
         Then I should find the Search extension in Marketplace input box

         When I search for Dependency Analytics plugin
          And I select the plugin
         Then I should find the OpenShift logo
          And I should find the Dependency Analytics header
          And I should find the Dependency Analytics title
          And I should find the Plugin install button

         When I start the installation by clicking on the Plugin install button
         Then I should find the Reload and Uninstall buttons
          And I should find the Reload button and Gear icon

         When I close the Visual Studio Code
         Then I should not find any Visual Studio Code instance
```

          And I move mouse cursor to the top left corner
          And I wait 2 seconds
         Then I should find the Reload and Uninstall buttons
          And I should find the Reload button and Gear icon

         # Close the Visual Studio Code
