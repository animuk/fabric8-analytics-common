== About fabric8-analytics CI/CD

CentOS CI builds and deploys all fabric8-analytics deployable units.
The following sections describe the setting up of CI/CD in CentOS for a new project.

.Prerequisite:
* You must have a Dockerfile for your new project and should be able to deploy the image to OpenShift (that is, you must have the OpenShift template).

If you do not have either of these, refer to the already deployed fabric8-analytics projects.

== Enabling CI/CD for a new project

=== 1. Have CI scripts in your repository

CI looks for certain scripts in your repository. These scripts are
basically CI job definitions. Common practice in CentOS CI is to have at
least the following two scripts in your repository:

* https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-pgbouncer/blob/master/cico_run_tests.sh[cico_run_tests.sh]
+
This script gets executed in CI on every pull request. The script should
build the docker image (if necessary) and run unit and first level
integration tests.

* https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-pgbouncer/blob/master/cico_build_deploy.sh[cico_build_deploy.sh]
+
This script gets executed on every merge to master branch. This script
should also build the docker image and run unit and integration tests.
If the tests pass, the script should push the docker image to the
`push.registry.devshift.net` registry.

It's also common to have following auxiliary script in your repository:

* https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-pgbouncer/blob/master/cico_setup.sh[cico_setup.sh]
+
Machines in CentOS CI, where all builds and tests run, are always clean, that is there is no docker installed. The purpose of this script is
to set up the CI environment and provide various helper functions that can
be used in both `cico_run_tests.sh` and `cico_build_deploy.sh` scripts.

* https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-pgbouncer/blob/master/Makefile[Makefile]
+
This is optional, it can be used by developers outside CI environment. `cico_*`
scripts expect that the environment is disposable, but the developer's
laptop is not.

It's usually a good idea to copy these scripts from an existing repository and
simply adapt them for your needs.

[[configure-cicd-jobs-in-almightyalmighty-jobs]]
=== 2. Configure CI/CD jobs in almighty/almighty-jobs

CentOS CI can find out about your project only if you configure a job
for it through
https://github.com/almighty/almighty-jobs[almighty/almighty-jobs] GitHub
repository. Basic templates for fabric8-analytics projects already
exist, a typical project can simply reuse the following snippets:

For pull requests:

[source,yaml]
----
        - '{ci_project}-{git_repo}-fabric8-analytics':    # template reference, keep intact
            git_organization: fabric8-analytics           # GitHub organization where your project lives
            git_repo: fabric8-analytics-data-model        # short name of the GitHub repository
            ci_project: 'devtools'                        # group in CI, keep intact
            ci_cmd: '/bin/bash cico_run_tests.sh'         # script to run on pull requests
            timeout: '20m'                                # how long to wait before giving up (reaching the time limit will fail the test/build)
----

For master branch builds:

[source,yaml]
----
        - '{ci_project}-{git_repo}-f8a-build-master':     # template reference, keep intact
            git_organization: fabric8-analytics           # GitHub organization where your project lives
            git_repo: fabric8-analytics-data-model        # short name of the GitHub repository
            ci_project: 'devtools'                        # group in CI, keep intact
            ci_cmd: '/bin/bash cico_build_deploy.sh'      # script to run on merge to master
            saas_git: saas-analytics                      # short name of the GitHub repository for tracking deployments; always [saas-analytics](https://github.com/openshiftio/saas-analytics)
            deployment_units: 'data-importer'             # "name" element from the saas-analytics configuration file, e.g.: https://github.com/openshiftio/saas-analytics/blob/master/bay-services/data-importer.yaml#L4
            deployment_configs: 'bayesian-data-importer'  # name of the OpenShift deployment config, e.g.: https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-data-model/blob/f058982e7b75dccf97b5adec9ea975530a1731fe/openshift/template.yaml#L29
            timeout: '20m'                                # how long to wait before giving up (reaching the time limit will fail the test/build)
----

If the build is successful and the first level tests pass on merge to master builds, then the new image will be automatically deployed to staging
environment and the E2E tests will run against it. If the E2E tests fail, CI
will automatically rollback the deployment to previous (working)
version.

Adjust values, where necessary, and open a PR
(https://github.com/almighty/almighty-jobs/pull/271/commits/2fe60ee7e0881d026889da2b67313a71869b8c85[example]).

[[configuration-in-deployment-tracking-repository]]
=== 3. Configuration in deployment tracking repository

A tool called https://github.com/openshiftio/saasherder[saasherder] is
responsible for all deployments to staging and production. All projects need to have a deployment configuration file in
https://github.com/openshiftio/saas-analytics/tree/master/bay-services[openshiftio/saas-analytics]
repository.

It may look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
- hash: 0f6d2d8f2e388d4562a0a029ef9485249e529a9d
  hash_length: 7
  name: data-importer
  environments:                     # deployments can be configured differently in staging and production
  - name: production
    parameters:
      REPLICAS: 4
  - name: staging
    parameters:
      REPLICAS: 1
  path: /openshift/template.yaml    # path where to find OpenShift template in the repository
url: https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-data-model/
----

See the https://github.com/openshiftio/saasherder#service-yaml[official
docs] for more information.

NOTE: If you want to deploy only your project to staging for now, you can
set `hash` to `none`.

[[configure-webhooks-in-your-repository]]
=== 4. Configure webhooks in your repository

The next step is to configure webhooks in your GitHub repository. Please refer to the
https://wiki.centos.org/QaWiki/CI/GithubIntegration[official CentOS CI
documentation] for more information.

[[configure-webhooks-in-your-repository]]
=== 5. Request quay.io image repository

Create issue in the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/[housekeeping] repository for CentOS and RHEL based images.

[[promoting-to-production]]
== Promoting to production

The version of a service which runs in production is controlled by the `hash` key in the corresponding deployment config file in the
https://github.com/openshiftio/saas-analytics/tree/master/bay-services[openshiftio/saas-analytics]
repository.

If you want to promote a new build to production, open a PR
(https://github.com/openshiftio/saas-analytics/pull/67/commits/215f0f06998f3659d65f6962fb9aa2bcc2fe4db9[example])
and contact @msrb, @srikrishna, or the Service Delivery team on MatterMost.
